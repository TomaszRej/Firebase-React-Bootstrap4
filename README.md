# Firebase-React-Bootstrap4

## Technologies I had used for this project are: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
#### This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It was my first attempt to react and firebase. 

### Functionality:
* user can login to the app
* this app displays orders stored in firebase cloud (depend on kind of order the color of it changes)
* user can sort orders
* user can export orders to CSV file.
* user can delete orders which will delete the records from database
